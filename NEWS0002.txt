   The Broadcom security and integrity CVSS CSV file can be downloaded from the 
   following location:

   In order for &G$PNAME to read this file, it must be made available in a      
   dataset or USS file. One way to accomplish this is by using FTP to           
   download the file to z/OS. The following sample JCL can be used to           
   download the CSV file via FTP:

      dataset.                                                                  
                                                                                
   3. <keyring> should be replaced with a valid SAF keyring name that contains

   6. <file> should be replaced with the name of a partitioned dataset (PDS)    
      or USS file path where the CSV file should be saved. This is the file     
      that &G$PNAME's SVWXCVSS member should be configured to read.

   To prevent SSL handshake failures when downloading the Broadcom security and 
   integrity CVSS CSV file from z/OS, the correct certificate needs to be       
   downloaded and made available in a SAF keyring. Follow these steps to enable 
   the secure download:                                                         
                                                                                
      1. Download the certificate to your local computer from the following     
         URL:

      2. Upload the certificate as text data to your z/OS system in RECFM=VB    
         and LRECL=84 format. If you use FTP, use the following FTP commands    
         to avoid truncation:

         quit

      3. Add the certificate to a SAF keyring. See the\KEYRINGS`command to      
         display a list of defined keyrings.                                    
                                                                                
   When downloading the CSV file from z/OS using HTTPS or FTP, the keyring      
   name where the certificate was added needs to be specified. For sample JCL

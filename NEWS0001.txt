   When downloading maintenance for SMP/E managed products, the process of      
   downloading individual PTFs to keep products up to date can be time          
   consuming. SMP/E provides RECEIVE ORDER requests that simplify and speed up  
   the process of obtaining maintenance. RECEIVE ORDER requests are used to     
   connect directly to mainframe software vendor sites and download all         
   available maintenance or HOLDDATA. For any mainframe software vendor that    
   supports RECEIVE ORDERs, requests can be submitted using line commands on

   &G$PNAME uses JCL to submit SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER requests. The JCL contains   
   vendor specific information, so different JCL needs to be used for each      
   vendor. To simplify the creation and configuration of vendor specific JCL    
   members, &G$PNAME provides JCL template members for mainframe software       
   vendors that support SMP/E RECEIVE ORDERs.

   The value that is defined to the RECEIVEORDER KEYWORD in SVWXPTFL displays   
   in the ReceiveOrder field on the PTFLIST command.                            
                                                                                
   There are several places in the template JCL that &G$PNAME provides that     
   need to be configured manually so that RECEIVE ORDER requests complete       
   successfully.                                                                
                                                                                
   1. The first line of each template JCL member starts with: )JOBCARD. When    
      the JCL is submitted, the first line is replaced by the job card that is  
      configured in &G$PNAME for the user that submitted the JCL. The job card  
)LINKCMD JOBCARD                                                                
      that is defined to SYSVIEW for a given user can be modified using the     
     \JOBCARD`command. Ensure that valid job cards are configured for all users 
      that submit RECEIVE ORDERs, including the user id that is running         
      &G$PNAME.. To update the job card for the user id that is running         
      &G$PNAME, a SYSVIEW administrator issues the PROFILE SWITCH <user-id>     
      command and then modifies the job card using the JOBCARD command.         
                                                                                
      Users can also copy the template JCL member into their USER CNM4BTMP      
      library and replace the )JOBCARD statement with a valid job card.         
                                                                                
   2. Each template JCL member contains an <ORDERSERVER> definition. For        
      example, the SVWROBRM member (by default) specifies the following         
      parameters:                                                               
                                                                                
      <ORDERSERVER                                                              
        url="https://eapi.broadcom.com/receiveorder"                            
        inventory="all"                                                         
        keyring="SMPERING"                                                      
        certificate="SMPE Client Certificate">                                  
      </ORDERSERVER>                                                            
                                                                                
      The keyring keyword must specify the keyring name that contains the user  
      certificate that is required to access the RECEIVE ORDER server. The      
      certificate keyword must specify the label of this user certificate.      
                                                                                
   3. Each template JCL member contains a <CLIENT> definition. For example,     
      the SVWROBRM member (by default) specifies the following parameters:      
                                                                                
      <CLIENT                                                                   
        downloadmethod="https"                                                  
        javahome="/usr/lpp/java/J8.0_64"                                        
        classpath="/usr/lpp/smp/classes"                                        
        javadebugoptions="-Dcom.ibm.smp.debug=severe -showversion">             
      </CLIENT>                                                                 
                                                                                
      The javahome keyword must specify a valid path to one of the following    
      Java installations or their logical successors:

      - IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS, Java Technology Edition Version 6 (5655-R32)   
                                                                                
      The classpath keyword must specify a valid path to the SMP/E Java         
      application classes that are supplied when SMP/E is installed. By default,
      the classes reside in the /usr/lpp/smp/classes directory.                 
                                                                                
      The javadebugoptions keyword can be updated to include any valid Java     
      option. The options can be used to debug and trace problems with RECEIVE  
      ORDER requests.                                                           
                                                                                
   4. If a proxy server is required to connect to the RECEIVE ORDER server,     
      an <HTTPPROXY> definition can be added to the <CLIENT> definition in the  
      template JCL. The <HTTPPROXY> definition has the following syntax:        
                                                                                
      <HTTPPROXY host="local.httpproxy.com"                                     
                 user="userid" pw="password" port="8080"> </HTTPPROXY>

   To submit SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER requests, use the\PTFLIST`command. The PTFLIST 
   command contains line commands that let you submit RECEIVE ORDER requests    
   for different content:

   3. RECVHold - Include all enhanced HOLDDATA                                  
                                                                                
   These line commands submit the JCL template member specified by the          
   ReceiveOrder field on PTFLIST on the row where the line command was entered.

                    on the row where the line command was entered. This         
                    variable is used in the SMPCSI DD in the template JCL to    
                    specify the SMP/E CSI that should be used.

   By scheduling and automating SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER requests, mainframe         
   software can be kept up to date with the latest and most important           
   maintenance. Scheduling and automating requests also helps to ensure that    
   you implement a standardized and consistent approach to downloading          
   maintenance for software across z/OS systems.

   RECEIVEGROUP keyword can be used in the\CNM4BPRM(SVWXPTFL)`member. This      
   keyword associates the entry with a group name. The value is displayed by    
   the ReceiveGroup field on the PTFLIST command. An automated process can then 
   use this field to easily submit RECEIVE ORDERs for each SMP/E product in a   
   given group.

   use the following syntax in the SVWXPTFL member:
